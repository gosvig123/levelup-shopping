# Level-up Shopping App

Welcome to the Shopping Time Tracker App repository! This app helps you create a shopping list, while also allowing you to time yourself to improve your shopping time, or time per item if you're a statistics enthusiast. Please note that this is version 1, and currently, the server does not store results, so the leaderboard scores will not persist through a page refresh.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to download and set up the project on your local machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gosvig123/levelup-shopping
   \```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   \```bash
   cd levelup-shopping
   \```

3. Install the dependencies:
   \```bash
   yarn
   \```

4. Start the development server:
   \```bash
   yarn dev
   \```

5. Open a new terminal and start the application:
   \```bash
   yarn start
   \```

At this point, the project should be running on your local machine.

## Usage

Once you have the app up and running, you can create a list of items that you need to buy. You can then start a timer to track your shopping time, and see how your shopping efficiency improves over time. While the leaderboard functionality is available, keep in mind that the scores will not persist through a page refresh, as the server currently does not have endpoints for storing results.
